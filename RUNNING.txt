            ===================================================
            Running The SISOB Data Extractor
            ===================================================

SISOB Data Extractor requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 6 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 6 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 6 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.


(2) Download and Install Apache TomEE Plus or Glassfish 4 as application serve.


(3) Configure Project Settings

Open and edit “sisob-data-extractor/data-extractor-rest-server/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/server.properties”.

(3.1) Set “server.url” (required)

The server.url variable should be set to the url location of web application. 
For instance: http://sistractor.iaia.lcc.uma.es/extractor.


(3.2) Set “server.docs.folder” (required) 

The  “server.docs.folder” is used to specify location of the project files.
This folder has to be created before and must contain the “db” and 
“gate-data-extractor-service” folders. These directories can be found in
the root folder of the project. They should be copied inside the 
“server.docs.folder”.

(4) Add the users to the database “system.h2.db” (H2 database provides
a tool for this purpose). It is placed in the  <server.url>/db folder. 
Passwords have to be encoded using SHA-256 algorithm.
By default a user “demo” (with password also “demo”) is created. If 
you want to add a new user, use the same parameters as the “demo” user.
Remember that the password has to be generated encode using SHA-256 algorithm.

(5) The other two databases, i.e. “locations” and “academic_data_traductions”
contain the dictionaries of the SISOB Data Extractor. For updating them
those databases have to be opened and edited. See how to do it in the 
official website of H2 database engine.

(6) Compile and Deploy the web application (i.e. the war file generated) in 
the application server.


================
Troubleshooting
================

Logs of the server application should be consulted if the SISOB Data Extractor
goes wrong after being deployed.
